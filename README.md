## JAVA FULL STACK DEVELOPER
- With 3+ years in the SDLC, I'm a proficient Java/J2EE software engineer. Experienced in Agile and Waterfall methodologies, I contribute to full software development cycles. Specializing in Java, I've mastered advanced concepts, multithreading, and Spring Framework modules. Beyond backend, I excel in front-end development using Angular, HTML5, CSS3, and more.
- My database expertise spans relational (MySQL, dB2, Oracle) and non-relational (MongoDB, Couchbase). I've configured web servers, deployed on IBM WebSphere, and managed WAR/JAR files. Well-versed in Design Patterns, I've worked with Elastic search, Couchbase, and Apache Kafka for microservices.
- In cloud and DevOps, I've integrated AWS, configured Docker with Maven, and utilized CloudFormation. Proficient in CICD pipelines (Jenkins) and OpenShift, I prioritize maintainable code, integration testing, and design consistency. Strong communication and problem-solving skills complement my quick learning and analytical mindset.

## WORK EXPERIENCE:

### CLIENT ONE:
- Involved in all phases of SDLC from designing till deploying the application and worked in Agile Methodology
- Proficient in developing software applications using JAVA, J2EE, JSP, and XML. Extensive use of Core Spring Framework for Dependency Injections, including SpringMVC for REST API's and Spring Boot for microservices.
- Worked with both relational (db2) and non-relational databases (Couchbase), developing Restful web-services for JSON exchange between UI and server-side using HTTP protocol.
- Designed user interface screens using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Angular 6, and Bootstrap. Implemented Angular validations, routing, and created various forms using data-driven and template-driven approaches.
- Deployed Web Applications using Maven, Jenkins for continuous integration, and configured CloudFormation templates for AWS infrastructure. Utilized Docker deployment pipelines, Kafka for streaming, and integrated Elastic search and Couchbase for logging and analytics.

### CLIENT TWO:
- Demonstrated problem-solving skills by resolving complex issues during development, considering multiple business and technology factors. Investigated emerging technologies and developed prototypes to showcase their applicability to the product roadmap.
- Implemented an efficient Agile Scrum methodology for development, utilizing core Java, J2EE technologies (Servlets, JDBC, JSP, Spring, Spring Boot), and Microservices architecture. Embraced Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices using Jenkins and Docker.
- Developed user interfaces and prototypes for web-based systems using Angular 6/7, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, and Bootstrap. Utilized Angular HTTP Module for API calls, migrated old Angular 2 forms to new forms, and ensured responsive web design with CSS Bootstrap.
Implemented DAO CRUD methods using Hibernate and Spring framework, designed and developed REST-based Microservices with Spring Boot. Conducted unit testing using Mockito and JUnit, and tested REST APIs in Spring-Controller with tools like Postman.
- Engaged in the entire DevOps lifecycle, including using Maven for build and deployment, Jenkins for continuous integration, log4j for logging, and configuring Jenkins for builds in AWS environment. Utilized JIRA for issue tracking, GIT for version control, Eclipse IDE for development, and Tomcat server for application deployment.
  
### CLIENT THREE: 
- Contributed to the full software development lifecycle using the Agile model, actively participating in daily SCRUM meetings. Interacted with business owners and UI developers to understand requirements and visualize product functionalities.
- Developed front-end code using JavaScript Framework, AngularJS, and jQuery to retrieve data from back-end RESTful servers. Implemented RESTful APIs using Spring Framework, designed controllers, and applied J2EE design patterns for efficient application development.
- Utilized tools like Maven for building and managing dependencies, GIT for version control. Implemented logging using log4j and developed test cases using the Mockito framework on Junit and TestNG runners. Developed and optimized stored procedures and triggers for efficient Oracle database interaction.
  
### CLIENT FOUR:
- Led the design and development of a web application using the Spring Framework. Configured the application using Spring Configuration files, wrote Action Classes, and Form Bean Classes.
- Performed MySQL coding for web applications, addressing defects collaboratively with QA, Business, and Architects. Improved database performance through MySQL configuration changes, multiple instances, and hardware upgrades.
- Deployed the application on the JBoss Application Server, utilized My Eclipse and Subversioning (SVN) for release management. Engaged in production support, monitoring server logs, foreseeing potential issues, and escalating to higher levels when necessary.
