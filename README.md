## JAVA FULL STACK DEVELOPER
- With 3+ years in the SDLC, I'm a proficient Java/J2EE software engineer. Experienced in Agile and Waterfall methodologies, I contribute to full software development cycles. Specializing in Java, I've mastered advanced concepts, multithreading, and Spring Framework modules. Beyond backend, I excel in front-end development using Angular, HTML5, CSS3, and more.
- My database expertise spans relational (MySQL, dB2, Oracle) and non-relational (MongoDB, Couchbase). I've configured web servers, deployed on IBM WebSphere, and managed WAR/JAR files. Well-versed in Design Patterns, I've worked with Elastic search, Couchbase, and Apache Kafka for microservices.
- In cloud and DevOps, I've integrated AWS, configured Docker with Maven, and utilized CloudFormation. Proficient in CICD pipelines (Jenkins) and OpenShift, I prioritize maintainable code, integration testing, and design consistency. Strong communication and problem-solving skills complement my quick learning and analytical mindset.
